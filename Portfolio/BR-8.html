        <h1>Re:BIRTH - Beyond Life, Beyond Death</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Industry:</strong> Game / Web Novel
            <br><br>
            <strong>Synopsis:</strong> 
            In a world where death is the end for most, for him, it was only the beginning. A lone genius—an outcast in his own life—known in the digital underworld as Root128, a feared grey-hat hacker, and in the game development world as Doctor Sterben, aspired to create the greatest fantasy game ever made. Yet, trapped in a reality that never understood him, burdened by expectations, and plagued by his fractured mind, he found solace only in the endless codes he weaved and the justice he delivered from the shadows. But fate had other plans. On the night of his greatest breakthrough, an incident shattered his world, leading to his untimely death. When his consciousness resurfaced, he found himself reborn—not in the world he once knew, but in a realm beyond imagination. A world of swords and magic, kingdoms and chaos, where fate was dictated by strength and power. Armed with his unparalleled intellect, memories of a past life, and an enigmatic system unlike any other, he embraces this new reality with cold resolve. He has no intention of looking back or questioning why he was given this second chance—only one thing matters now: what he will do with it. As the past and present collide, the true game begins. This is the story of a man who defied fate. This is the story of his second chance. This is Re:Birth.
